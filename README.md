# 1. Business Problem.
  *Disclaimer: the business problem presented below is fictcious as well as Life Safety company. The dataset was collected from Kaggle's competition [Health Insurance Cross Sell](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction).*
  
  Life Safety is a B2C company whose core business is offering health insuerance to individuals. Now it plans to implement a cross sell strategy focused on distribuiting car insurance to its customer base. 
  
  Given that the budget for the sales is limited, it is necessary to prioritize those customers who are more likely to purchase the product. Then, a Data Scientist was consulted to build **a model to order the customer base by propensity score**. 
  
  To deal with this *learn to rank* challenge, Life Safety undertook a survey with 381000 customers, and they answered whether they were interested or not in insurance car offer. The train dataset was produced with the customers attributes and theirs responses to this survey   
 
  Two **data products** was developed to assist business team:
   
   1. Cumulative gains curve 
   2. Google Spreadsheet for automatic predictions
